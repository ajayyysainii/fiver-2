What Is FamilyLegacyPlatform?
FamilyLegacyPlatform is a self-hosted digital platform designed to help families organize their legacy, communicate privately, and connect with trusted professionals — all while maintaining full ownership and control of their data.
Unlike traditional SaaS platforms, we do not host your information, manage your servers, or store your data. You receive the software, install it on your own hosting environment, and control everything.
Your legacy. Your infrastructure. Your rules.
Built for Families Who Value Control
FamilyLegacyPlatform was created for families who care about:
Privacy
Independence
Long-term planning
Trusted professional relationships
When you use our platform, your family:
Owns the software
Chooses the hosting provider
Controls the database
Decides who has access
There are no hidden data dependencies and no forced hosting relationships.
Two Sides. One Trusted Ecosystem.
FamilyLegacyPlatform is made up of two connected but separate experiences:
🏠 Family Platform
Families receive the full platform after a one-time setup fee.
Family features include:
Private family access
Internal communication tools
Legacy organization features
Secure connection to the Family Marketplace
Self-hosted installation on your own server
Families pay:
$200 one-time setup
$10/month platform license
💼 Professional Marketplace
Professionals join only to access the Family Marketplace.
Professionals:
Do not receive the full family platform
Do not access family data
Do not manage family systems
They can:
Create a professional profile
Post services and content
Message paid family users
Build long-term professional relationships
Professional access is limited, licensed, and verified.
A Private, Paid-Only Marketplace
The Family Marketplace is not a public directory.
Only:
Paid families using FamilyLegacyPlatform
Approved professionals with active licenses
can participate.
There is:
No shopping cart
No in-platform payments
No transaction processing
The marketplace exists solely for connection, communication, and trust.
Self-Hosted by Design
FamilyLegacyPlatform is intentionally designed as self-hosted software.
This means:
You connect your own domain
You choose your hosting provider
You manage your own database
You control your backups and security
We provide:
The software
Updates
Usage guidance
Optional support add-ons
We do not:
Log into your servers
Manage databases
Access private data
Act as a hosting provider
Support Without Overreach
We support users by:
Explaining how the software works
Providing documentation and guidance
Offering optional customer support add-ons
We never:
Operate your infrastructure
Handle sensitive data
Access private family content
This structure protects both your family and our platform.
Designed for Long-Term Legacy
FamilyLegacyPlatform is not a trend product or short-term tool.
It is built for:
Multi-generational families
Long-term planning
Private networks
Sustainable professional relationships
This platform grows with your family — not at your family’s expense.
